# Campus Trading Platform - Group 3 Team

This GitHub repo is for our MIS Systems Seminar Group 3 project, where we’re learning Agile Scrum project management techniques.

## Project Description

We’re building a campus trading post platform that allows students to buy, sell, and trade things like textbooks, clothes, and other secondhand items. The goal is to create a platform that makes it easier for students to exchange items within their campus community, while also promoting sustainability by reducing waste.

The file structure of this project keeps the trading post demo separate from our team's landing page and the individual member subpages. The trading post platform is currently being referred to as a demo, and you can access it from the main homepage.

The project repository for development is hosted on github.com, and makes use of the github pages feature to host the team homepage and subpages, as well as the trading post demo.

## Vision Statement

To build an easy-to-use online platform that allows students to buy, sell, and trade items directly with each other. By simplifying the exchange of goods within the campus community, we aim to create a marketplace that empowers students to buy items they need, earn money from selling items, and foster a culture of convenience and collaboration.
