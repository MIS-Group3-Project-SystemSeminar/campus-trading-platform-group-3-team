                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a Computer Science graduate from the University of Arkansas and a current Walton College of Business Information Systems Master's student, working as an IT Project Manager. Through my journey in computer science, I've cultivated robust technical literacy and a knack for swiftly adapting to emerging technologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my current role at UARK Admissions School & College Relations in Fayetteville, AR, I excel in providing comprehensive computer and database support, both in-person and remotely. I troubleshoot issues within platforms like PeopleSoft and Slate, develop Python scripts, and manage SFTP processes to ensure seamless operations within the Admissions department. Additionally, I actively contribute to Workday Student testing and streamline processes such as Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) Transcripts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Prior to this, I gained vital experience as a Technology Center Technician at the UARK Student Technology Center, where I assisted across hardware and software domains, managed 3D printing orders, and enhanced the tech center's online presence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My role as a 3D Environment Artist at the UARK Tesseract Center for Game Design has been particularly fulfilling. Collaborating closely with the art director, I've defined visual aesthetics, authored procedural tiling textures, and created optimized 3D assets for various applications. Notable contributions to projects like <em>A House of The Ozarks</em> and <em>A Winter Scene in Brooklyn</em> underscore my commitment to delivering high-quality work within project timelines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond my professional pursuits, I'm deeply engaged in personal projects that mirror my passion for cutting-edge technologies and creativity. Volunteering at a tech recycling non-profit, Free Geek Arkansas, speaks to my dedication to sustainability and technology education.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my free time, I enjoy honing my skills in tailoring, sewing, costume design, 3D printing, and other creative endeavors.
