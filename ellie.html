                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a Computer Science graduate from the University of Arkansas, current Walton College of Business Information Systems Master' student, and I am currently employed as a IT Project Manager. Through my journey in computer science, I've cultivated a robust technical literacy and a knack for swiftly adapting to emerging technologies.

                    <br>In my current role at UARK Admissions School & College Relations, Fayetteville, AR, I excel in providing comprehensive computer and database support, both in-person and remotely. From troubleshooting issues within platforms like Peoplesoft and Slate to developing Python scripts and managing SFTP processes, I ensure seamless operations within the Admissions department. Additionally, I actively contribute to Workday Student testing and streamline processes like processing Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) Transcripts.

                    <br>Prior to this, I gained vital experience as a Technology Center Technician at UARK Student Technology Center, Arkansas Union, Fayetteville, AR. Here, I offered assistance across hardware and software domains, managed 3D printing orders, and contributed to enhancing the tech center's online presence.

                    <br>My foray into 3D artistry as a 3D Environment Artist at UARK Tesseract Center for Game Design has been particularly fulfilling. Collaborating closely with the art director, I've defined visual aesthetics, authored procedural tiling textures, and created optimized 3D assets for various applications. Notably, my contributions to projects like "A House of The Ozarks" and "A Winter Scene in Brooklyn" underscore my commitment to delivering high-quality work within project timelines.

                    <br>Beyond my professional pursuits, I'm deeply engaged in personal projects that mirror my passion for cutting-edge technologies and creativity. Volunteering at a tech recycling non-profit, Free Geek Arkansas, speaks to my dedication to sustainability and technology education.

                    <br>I spend my free time improving my skills with tailoring, sewing, costume design, and 3D printing, and other generally creative pursuits.
